                                        Approaching an attractive, desirable lady for the first time isn’t always easy. Your heart rate increases while beads of sweat roll down your temple. Although this is a natural response, your nervousness can negatively affect the outcome of your initial interaction. This is even more challenging when you’re attempting to connect with someone from a foreign culture, who speaks a different language.

Whichever scenario applies to you; know that we’ve created our packages with you in mind. Our Membership Program offers a variety of plans. Depending on the benefits you desire, you may choose the Gold, Platinum or VIP Package. Although the packages all have a monthly rate, they’re billed in 3-month increments.

                                        Ukraine is a well-kept secret as a beautiful tourist destination.
